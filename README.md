personal-distro
===============

A personal linux distribution I use to save time configuring new machines, and a few scripts to help update the build regularly. I'm codenaming them after the after the middle names of Harry Potter characters that start with the same letter of the distributions of Debian GNU/Linux they are based on. I'm going to have a repository mirror up soon, I just have to find a VPS I like.
